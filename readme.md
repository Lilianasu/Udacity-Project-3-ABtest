This project covers the Probability unit from Coursera's Data Analyst Data Nanodegree, which includes:

- Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb, Jupyter Notebook with the analysis
- Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook. html, in html format

The client requested an analysis of the actual (old) and the new websites in the control and experiment groups of users. We will analize the data through an A/B test to help making a decision if the actual pages leads to more or equal conversions of users or not. 

Part I - Wrangling of the dataset

Part II - A/B Test through a null and alternative hypotesis

Part III - Logistic Regression models with the statsmodels library
